## Contributing to xobox

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to xobox, which
is hosted in the [Stormrose Organization](https://github.com/stormrose-va/) on
GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel
free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### Reporting Issues

One important contribution you can do without coding knowledge is reporting issues you detected during your daily work
with xobox. Generally, an issue can be either a defect (i. e. xobox does not work as documented), a change request (e.
g. propose a new feature that would ease your life as xobox user), or a request for support or clarification (e. g.
where the xobox documentation is not plain and explicit).

Issues can be reported through our [tracker](https://github.com/stormrose-va/xobox/issues) on GitHub. Before filling
the form and pressing on send, please take a few seconds and

* ensure the issue was not reported before by searching the [tracker](https://github.com/stormrose-va/xobox/issues).
  Dealing with duplicate reports is a dull, administrative work that consumes our time and reduces our capacity to
  work on fixes or new features, so performing this quick search is for your own good :wink:
* check you have all the relevant information to fill in the
  [issue template](https://github.com/stormrose-va/xobox/blob/master/.github/issue_template.md) as accurately as
  possible. Querying you for additional information takes time (ours and yours) and slows down resolution of the
  issue, so being as comprehensive as possible is a good deal for all involved parties :+1:
* take a quick look at our
  [documentation on issue management](https://stormrose-va.github.io/xobox/internals/issues.html). It's not that long
  to read, but should give you a basic understanding of issue labels and how we work with issues :rocket:
  
#### Contributing Documentation

Writing documentation is always a tedious job for developers. We did our best to facilitate documenting xobox by setting
up a mostly automated build and deploy system for the documentation. However, you're more than welcome if you want to
improve the documentation in any which way (mind, not all developers are English native speakers...).

We have a defined process in place for updating everything related to xobox, and that includes the documentation.
Please have a look at this process in the
[Project Documentation](https://stormrose-va.github.io/xobox/internals/index.html).

#### Contributing Code

If you want to support us by contributing to the code works, please familiarize with the
[Project Documentation](https://stormrose-va.github.io/xobox/internals/index.html). This is a key resource to understand
xobox' development process and governance.

#### Contact

GitHub does not provide direct means of contacting the development team or members of it, but there's a marvellous
issue tracker that might help you around that: If you want to get in touch to discuss ways of contributing, the
recommended way is to [create an issue](https://github.com/stormrose-va/xobox/issues/new) and assign the `team`
label to it. We will then come back to you; just grant us a bit of time -- xobox is developed by volunteers in their
free time, so we might not be able to police the issue tracker on a daily basis.
