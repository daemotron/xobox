# xobox

xobox (pronounced *zoobox*) is a flight data analysis tool focusing on X-Plane flight data logs. The name is derived
from the cognomen frequently used for flight data recorders by non-aviation folks ("black box") and the fact that this
box is actually orange (so it's an "orange box").

xobox is designed to process X-Plane's flight data log files and condense the extensive log information into a more
practical reporting format. The more data fields were activated when recording the flight, the more detailed the
final report will become.
